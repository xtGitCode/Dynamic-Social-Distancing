# Social Distancing Stimulator
Develop a program 
- to have an automatic mechanism that takes into account a locationâ€™s maximum capacity, practicing social distancing proactively
- to take into account if someone was in a close-contact of a Covid patient, and dynamically calculate social distance accordingly and determine status (e.g., casual contact)

 Display social distancing fail message and guide the user to move in which direction and how
 far. If user is in contact with a close contact then display a warning alert message and update
 the status of user to casual contact. Display user details and tell user to input distance again
 after following steps above (will keep asking for a distance until social distancing pass).
